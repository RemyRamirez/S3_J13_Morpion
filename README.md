Project S3_J13_Morpion

Made with <3 by Remy Ramirez & Alexis Martin
(no it's a joke not <3 it was so difficult Ruby I hate you)

before launching make sure you have done a $ bundle install to upload your gem

To launch the game make a $ ruby app.rb at the roots and let it go

Content:
- app.rb --> launch it to execute through application file all the other files
6 files in /lib corresponding to 6 class:
  - Player : all the action regarding players
  - boardcase : setup action on one boardcase of the game
  - platform : actions linked to the the platform and modification on it
  - show : display the platform
